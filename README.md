## 👋 About Me

I am a **Ph.D. applicant** passionate about robotics, control, and machine learning,
currently pursuing my undergraduate studies at the **University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)**
and completing a visiting term at the **University of Wisconsin–Madison**.

I am particularly fascinated by how control theory and modern learning methods  
can be combined to build **human-centered robotic intelligence**.

## 🧪 Selected Projects

### [Robot Arm Teleoperation](https://github.com/1EastonJ/vive_piper)
A VR-based teleoperation framework for intuitive control of robotic arms.  
Integrated inverse kinematics, motion smoothing, and real-time control visualization.

### Model-based UAV Tracking
Designed and implemented a robust UAV tracking system capable of filtering spatial clutter and maintaining accurate trajectories under noisy sensor conditions.
Utilized an Interacting Multiple Model – Unscented Kalman Filter (IMM-UKF) framework for state estimation, achieving over 99% tracking accuracy compared to GPS ground truth.

## 🎯 Goal

I am seeking **Ph.D. opportunities starting Fall 2026** in robotics and machine learning.  
I am especially interested in programs and labs focusing on **learning-based control, teleoperation, and robot autonomy**.

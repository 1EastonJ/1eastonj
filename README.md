## 👋 About Me

I am a **Ph.D. applicant** passionate about **robotics, control, and machine learning**,  
currently completing my studies at the **University of Wisconsin–Madison**.  
My interests lie in developing **intelligent and adaptive robotic systems** that can perceive, learn,  
and interact naturally with humans and their environments.

I am particularly fascinated by how control theory and modern learning methods  
can be combined to build **human-centered robotic intelligence**.

## 🧪 Selected Projects

### [Robot Arm Teleoperation](https://github.com/1EastonJ/vive_piper)
A VR-based teleoperation framework for intuitive control of robotic arms.  
Integrated inverse kinematics, motion smoothing, and real-time control visualization.

### Autonomous Navigation Simulation
Developed path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms for multi-agent scenarios using ROS and Gazebo.

### Learning-based Control Experiments
Implemented policy-gradient reinforcement learning for nonlinear pendulum stabilization in simulation.

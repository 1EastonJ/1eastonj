The **BSense** project develops a wide-area UAV detection and localization framework leveraging **5G-Advanced base stations**.  
It integrates 3D-UKF and IMM filtering to enhance detection robustness under noisy environmental conditions, achieving higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and localization accuracy.  
Currently **under submission to MobiCom 2026** (expected decision: early 2026).
